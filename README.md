> **A robust Content Management System (CMS) designed for creating, organizing, and sharing dynamic content with ease.**



## 📋 Overview

The **Blog Management System** is a full-featured web application that allows users to create, edit, and categorize content. It moves beyond a simple webpage by implementing dynamic content rendering, a comment moderation system, and a powerful search engine.

This project demonstrates proficiency in **Django's MVT architecture**, database relationships (ForeignKey/ManyToMany), and CRUD operations.

## 🔄 Architecture: Content Lifecycle

The system manages data through a strict lifecycle to ensure quality and organization.

| Stage | Status | Description | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Creation** | **Draft** | Content is saved locally; visible only to the author. | `Create` / `Update` |
| **Review** | **Pending** | (Optional) Content is queued for admin approval. | `Review` |
| **Public** | **Published** | Content is live; indexed for search and open for comments. | `Read` / `Comment` |
| **Archive** | **Archived** | Old content is preserved but removed from the main feed. | `Soft Delete` |
